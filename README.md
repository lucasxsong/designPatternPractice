# designPatternPractice

Just a quick few examples of various design patterns to help understand the material better. 

## Iterator Pattern

Bringing iteration of an aggregate into an object outside of the aggregate. Allows for design of multiple traversal patterns within the same aggregate without adding more complexity into the base object.

## Visitor Pattern

Coupled with iterator pattern, allows for a visitor to perform some sort of operation by visiting an object that "accepts" it. Also useful in decreasing the amount of complexity in a singular class by dividing up the work. 

## Command Pattern

Allows for an object to represent a "state" of an object is it manipulating. Allows for the idea of command history, bridging the gap to allow undo and redo.
